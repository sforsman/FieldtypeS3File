FieldtypeS3File
===============

First version of a File -field that is stored directly on Amazon S3. The aim of this
module is to extend the existing core implementations as much as possible to retain
compatibility, familiar interface and of course to benefit from the existing logic
(mainly the AJAX-uploading mechanism). 

There are a few important features that are missing and also a few notes to take into
consideration. These can be found in the comments of FieldtypeS3File.module.php.
